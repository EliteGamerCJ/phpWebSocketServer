- 2021-09-28 echo back to client implemented

- 2021-09-25 php script nac now talk to other script 


- 2021-??-?? Runtime parameters are now read from file specified with option   
-i &lt;inifile> ; default is websock.ini in server directory

- 2021-08-22 Server and client can now handle very long messages (>8192B)   
no longer need to use own buffer mechanism.

**NO DEPENDENCIES**

implemented by  
- **Heinz Schweitzer** https://github.com/napengam/phpWebSocketServer 
to work for communicating over secure websocket wss://
and accept any other socket connection by PHP processes or other 

WebSocketServer is based on the implementation in PHP by  
- **Bryan Bliewert**, nVentis@GitHub https://github.com/nVentis/PHP-WebSocketServer

The idea of *application classes' is taken from  
- **Simon Samtleben** https://github.com/bloatless/php-websocket

# What is it good for ?

This server allows you to establish communication between web applications living in a browser  
and enables backend scripts, in my case PHP, to communicate information back to web applications that 
have called the backend script to perform some action.

Clients receive a UUID from the server upon connection. If the web application triggers  
backend scripts via AJAX it passes the UUID to the backend scripts. The script is now able to report  
back to the web client by sending the UUID along with an opcode 'feedback' and other parameters to the server.  
With the given UUID the server now knows to what web client to send the message. Loop closed !

See example in directory webClient
